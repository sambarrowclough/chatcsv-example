## Getting started

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
